=head1 NAME

Perl5::Build::Warnings - Parse make output for build-time warnings

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Perl5::Build::Warnings;

    my $self = Perl5::Build::Warnings->new( { file => '/path/to/make.log' } );

    my $hashref = $self->get_warnings_groups;

    my $arrayref = $self->get_warnings;

    $self->report_warnings_groups;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Perl5::Build::Warnings is a module for use in studying build-time warnings
emitted by F<make> when building the Perl 5 core distribution from source
code.

=head2 Prerequisites

CPAN module F<Capture::Tiny> is used in this library's test suite, but not in
the module itself.  There are currently no other prerequisites not found in
the Perl 5 core distribution.

=head2 Assumptions

=head3 Logging of F<make> Output

The module assumes that the user has logged the output of F<make> (or
F<make test_prep> -- but not F<make test> -- or Windows equivalents) to a
plain-text file.  Something like:

    make test_prep 2>&1 > /path/to/make.log

=head3 Format for Build-Time Warnings

The module assumes that within such a logfile, warnings are recorded in this
format:

    op.c:5468:34: warning: argument ‘o’ might be clobbered by ‘longjmp’ or ‘vfork’ [-Wclobbered]

That is,

    <filename>:<line_numbert>:<character_number>: warning: <warning_description> [-<Wwarning_class>]

Note that the first field recorded, C<filename> may be either the basename of
a file in the top-level of the source code or a relative path to a file
beneath the top-level.

Note further that the last field recorded, the class of warning, starts with
an open bracket (C<[>), followed by a hyphen and an upper-case 'W' (C<-W>),
followed by the warning class, followed by a close bracket (C<]>).  In this
module we will ignore the open and close brackets and the hyphen, but we will
capture and report the upper-case 'W'.  Hence, whereas the log will record

    [-Wclobbered]

... this module will store and report that information as:

    Wclobbered

This is done in part because we may wish to use this data on the command-line
and the hyphen is likely to be significant to the shell.

=head1 INSTALLATION

To install:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

If you are on a windows box you should use 'nmake' rather than 'make'.
